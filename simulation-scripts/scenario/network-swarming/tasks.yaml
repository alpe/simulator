      text: I wonder what the services for the 'database' and 'api' are called? I
        think the names might be obvious.
    - penalty: 10
      text: I don't think the API will be useful, can I look at the database from
        here?
    - penalty: 10
      text: Many databases are SQL based, could it be one of the popular ones?
    - penalty: 10
      text: I wonder what the default username for the database is.

      text: One of the devs mentioned a Postgres database they used didn't have a
        password, could this be it?

      text: Hmm, how do I list tables and view the keys in tables again?

    summary: We used the db service in the namespace to connect to a database psql
      and find some secret data. We should not have been able to do this given our
      starting location.
  "2":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: The database shouldn't be talking to the frontend.

      text: I wonder if a network policy would help here.

    summary: A Network Policy was implemented to prevent the frontend pods from interacting
      with the database.
