  "1":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: Find open SSH port in workload. You can use nmap. Remember it runs on
        a NodePort.
    - penalty: 10
      text: The open NodePort was 30022. Brute force host SSH default password.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Username is admin and password is password.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Look around for credentials and tools. Can you hit the API?
    - penalty: 10
      text: Use wget to hit the API at default port 6443. The service account token
        looks like it can schedule workloads and get secrets.
    sortOrder: 1
    startingPoint:
      kubectlAccess: false
      mode: internal-instance
    summary: We brute forced access to an SSH pod in the cluster with an active node
      port and weak password. We then used the pods elevated permissions to get secrets.
  "2":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: What identity is assigned the pod?
    - penalty: 10
      text: Have a look at the roles and rolebindings.
    - penalty: 10
      text: Since the pod doesn't need to talk to the API, you can just delete the
        rolebinding.
    sortOrder: 2
    startingPoint:
      kubectlAccess: true
      mode: internal-instance
    summary: We removed the rolebinding giving elevated permissions to the pod.
  "3":
    hints:
    - penalty: 10
      text: Don't use passwords for SSH connections, and definitely not easy ones.
    sortOrder: 3
    startingPoint:
      mode: null
    summary: 'We should not use passwords for SSH. Where we do need to use passwords
      we should not pick simple or obvious ones. '
